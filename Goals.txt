The goal of this project is to provide a canned out of the box runnable Grails application, maybe a plug-in, that can be used to run a User Group in the format used by the phxjug.org and now the sbjug.org. Additionally, the license is written to exact one payment from other groups that use the code base.  A free and clear link back to sbjug.org such that sbjug.org gets some appreciation for the efforts to develop this application.

Use newer technology for demonstration and exploration purposes:
Responsive Design using HTML5 and CSS MediaQueries for UI
Grails 2.1 for development
MongoDB for database.
Git/Github for source control
